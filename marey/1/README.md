marey chart of mta gtfs feed

just shows 6 trains

- why do some trains travel backwards?
- why do some trains have system times so different than arrival time? orange dots show arrivals that dropped out of the feed before their arrival time. blue does show arrivals that were still in the feed after their arrival time. i think the timestamps have a ~30 second resolution, so a little variation is probably okay. 



Switching from short to long id (which includes direction of travel) removes some but not all zig zags. Using the full id removes almost all of them, but adds some long delays.

100450_6..N03R still moves through stations out of order. It has some arrival v system delays, but not huge ones. 



 Rush-hour 6 trains are supposed to come roughly every two minutes
